| Espresso                    | 2 cups (8 double shots + water) |
| Dark rum (optional)         | 2 tbsp                          |
| Large egg yolks             | 8                               |
| Sugar                       |                                 | 80g-100g |
| All purpose flour           | 2 tbsp                          |
| Whipping cream              |                                 | 450g     |
| Mascarpone cheese           |                                 | 1lb      |
| Semi sweet chocolate shaved |                                 | 6-8oz    |

## Steps

1. Dip the ladyfingers in the espresso mix and flip them thrice quickly and place them in the pan
2. Whisk egg yolk, sugar and flour in a heavy sauce pan
3. Cook over medium heat stirring constantly until mixture thickens (2-3 minutes) - this pasteurizes the egg without scrambling it
4. Remove from heat and add marsala (optional)
5. In a separate bowl whip cream until it has soft peaks
6. Beat mascarpone lightly and add egg yolk mixture. Mix until smooth
7. Take one-third of the whipped cream and mix it into the mascarpone–egg yolk mixture. Then fold in the remaining whipped cream
8. Spread half over pan
9. Assemble the next layer of ladyfingers by dipping them in the espresso mix and flipping them thrice quickly and placing them in the pan
10. Spread the remaining half of the cream over the pan
11. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours - it lasts for 3 days
12. Before serving, sift cocoa and sprinkle them evenly
13. Add thinly shaved chocolate over it

## Notes

1. Soaking the ladyfingers longer would make them brittle and crumbly
2. Breaking the egg and separating the yolk is easier when they’re cold straight from the fridge.
3. Using mascarpone straight from the fridge helps maintain a smooth, creamy texture
4. To make a creamier version, add 0.5lbs more mascarpone cheese
5. To also make it more fluffy and airy, add 200g more whipped cream.
