## Steps

### For the crust
- Adiust an oven rack to the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 325째F [165째C].
- Line a 9 by 13 in [23 by 33 cm] pan with a parchment sling.
- Whisk together the graham cracker crumbs and sugar in a medium bowl.
- Add the melted butter and mix with a spatula until evenly incorporated.
- Press the mixture onto the bottom of the prepared pan and bake for 10 minutes.
- Remove the pan from the oven and let cool. After the pan has cooled, wrap the outside sides in two layers of aluminum foil, with the shiny side facing out (this helps keep the sides of the cheesecake from browning).

### For the cheesecake
- In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until light and completely smooth, 4 to 5 minutes.
- Scrape down the sides of the bowl often, making sure all the cream cheese has incorporated and is silky smooth.
- Add 1 1/2 cups (300g of the sugar and beat on medium speed until completely incorporated, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed, 2 to 3 minutes.
- Add the sour cream, vanilla, salt, and butter, and beat on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating on low speed after each addition until just combined.
- Using a spatula, give the filling a couple of turns to make sure it is fully mixed.

### Assemble
- Pour the filling over the coolen crust and use an offset spatula to smooth the top.
- Bang the bottom of the pan on the counter a few times to help get rid of any air bubbles.
- Bake the cheesecake until the center of the cheesecake registers 150째F [65째C], 30 to 35 minutes.
- The outside 2 to 3 in [5 to 8 cm] of the cheesecake will be puffed and fairly firm and set, but the center will still be jiggly at this point.
- Turn off the heat, open the oven door just a crack, and let the cheesecake rest and cool in the warm oven for 30 minutes.
- Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool. Once the cheesecake is completely cool, place a piece of parchment over the top of the pan (this helps keep condensation off the top of the cheesecake) and transfer it to the refrigerator.
- Let chill for at least 6 hours or overnight.
