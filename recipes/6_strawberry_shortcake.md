## Ingredients

| Item | Measurement | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strawberries + Whipped cream | | |
| Strawberries | 6-7 cups | |
| Granulated sugar | 75g | |
| Vanilla extract | 1 tsp | |
| Heavy cream | 1 cup | |
| Biscuits | | |
| All purpose flour | 2 and 3/4 cups | 345g |
| Granulated sugar | 1/4 cup | 50g |
| Baking powder | 4 tsp | |
| Baking soda | 1/2 tsp | |
| Fine sea salt | 1 tsp | |
| Unsalted butter (cubed and cold) | 3/4 cup | 180g |
| Cold buttermilk | 1 cup | |
| Heavy cream | 2 tbsp | |

## Pre-requirements

1. Dice the strawberries into small pieces
2. Stir the strawberries and sugar - I use only 20g of sugar or a pump of sugar syrup
3. Set in the refrigerator
4. It needs at least 6 hours to start releasing the juices - so the longer the better

## Steps

1. Pre-heat oven to 400ËšF
2. Mix flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl
3. Add cubed butter and cut into the dry ingredients using a pastry cutter or pulsing several times
4. Pulse until coarse crumbs fall
5. Pour buttermilk on top
6. Fold them together with a rubber spatula until it begins to come together - DO NOT overwork the dough. It's okay to be shaggy and crumbly with some wet spots
7. Pour the dough and crumbs into a floored surface
8. Flatten it into a rectangle 3/4 inch thick
9. Fold one side into the center and the other side
10. Flatten it into a rectangle again
11. Repeat the folding and flatten them into a rectangle 3/4 inch thick
12. Cut into 2.75 inch or 3 inch biscuit cutters
13. Arrange in a skillet or a baking sheet - make sure they're touching each other
14. Mix 2 tablespoons of heavy cream with a bit of butter milk. Use this mixture to brush the tops
15. Bake for 18-22 minutes until biscuits are golden brown on the top
16. Cool at least 10 minutes before assembling
17. For the whipped cream, use a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream, granulated sugar, vanilla mixture on medium until soft-medium peaks form
18. Slice the biscuits in half and layer with strawberries and whipped cream
