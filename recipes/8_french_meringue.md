## Ingredients

| Item | Measurement | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Almond flour |  | 90g |
| Egg white (room temperature)| | 75g |
| Granulated sugar | | 50g |
| Powdered sugar | | 135g |
| Food coloring | | |

## Steps

1. Sift the almond flour into a mixing bowl. Measure the egg whites into a clean mixing bowl.
2. Using a whisk attachment, start whipping the egg whites on medium speed and slowly add the granulated sugar.
3. Gradually increase speed, and slowly incorporate the powdered sugar and continue to whisk the whites until they form a glossy stiff meringue and the sugar is dissolved.
4. Add the color and whisk just until combined.
5. Carefully fold the almond flour into the meringue in thirds and gently blend. We're folding and NOT blending. Be careful not to overmix.
6. Put the mixture into a pastry bag. Pipe small rounds on a parchment lined baking sheet. Let it rest on the baking sheet for 15-20 minutes.
7. Bake at 160°C (320°F) for about 12 minutes. Cool on a cooling rack and then remove from paper. The cookies should come off easily if they're cooked enough.

### Note:
1. After piping, drop the baking sheet on a flat surface a couple of times from a height of about 10cms - this helps to get the air bubbles out.
2. It is important for the heat in the oven to be consistent - so do NOT open the oven until we're done with 12 minutes.
3. Temperature accuracy is very important, so buy a oven thermometer and rely on that reading.
